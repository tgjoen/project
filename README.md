# README.md
This repository contains the two files used to create a shiny widget for the Coursera "Develop data products" course. The widget takes input via sliders to create two datasets: Control and Test. Using the sliders, the user can select sample size, mean and SD for the two datasets and the widget will plot a density distribution for the two sets. In addition, the widget will perform a two-sided T-test on the two sets to give the user some estimates for better select sample sized for the study in question.
